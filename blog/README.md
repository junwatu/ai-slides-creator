# Automate slides creation using OpenAI and Node.js

A detailed guide on how to create slides using OpenAI's Assistant API and DALL-E 3. This process allows for the automated creation of engaging and visually appealing slide presentations, leveraging the capabilities of both the Assistant API for content generation and DALL-E 3 for image creation.

## **Setup and Initialization**

- Create an OpenAI account and obtain an API key.
- Install the necessary Node.js packages such as `openai` and `pptxgenjs`.

## **Generating Content**

- Use the Assistant API to generate the text content for each slide. This involves prompting the API with a topic and receiving structured content that can be used in a presentation format.

## **Creating Visuals with DALL-E 3**

- Use DALL-E 3 to create images based on the text generated by the Assistant API. This is done by sending text prompts to DALL-E 3 and receiving images that visually represent the slide content.

## **Combining Text and Images**

- Use a Python script to combine the text and images into a cohesive slide format. The script uses the Pillow library to place text and images onto a slide template.

## **Outputting the Slides**

- The final slides are saved as image files which can be compiled into a presentation using tools like PowerPoint or Google Slides.
