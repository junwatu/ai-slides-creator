# Automate slides creation using OpenAI and Node.js

With the rise of AI tools, we can automate many manual workloads, including creating presentation slides. Leveraging OpenAI's language models and Node.js, developers can generate slide content programmatically. This automation surely will saves time. By using OpenAI for content generation and Node.js for orchestration, you can streamline the process of creating compelling and informative presentations effortlessly.

In this post we will use the Assistant API and DALL-E 2 model from OpenAI to automate slide content creation and then use Node.js to create the slide document.

## **Setup and Initialization**

- Create an OpenAI account and obtain an API key.
- Install the necessary Node.js packages such as `openai` and `pptxgenjs`.

## Input Data

- Provides data example.
- Limit the data format scope.

## **Generating Content**

- Use the Assistant API to generate the text content for each slide. This involves prompting the API with a topic and receiving structured content that can be used in a presentation format.

## **Creating Visuals with DALL-E 3**

- Use DALL-E 3 to create images based on the text generated by the Assistant API. This is done by sending text prompts to DALL-E 3 and receiving images that visually represent the slide content.

## **Combining Text and Images**

- Use a Python script to combine the text and images into a cohesive slide format. The script uses the Pillow library to place text and images onto a slide template.

## **Outputting the Slides**

- The final slides are saved as image files which can be compiled into a presentation using tools like PowerPoint or Google Slides.
